  <p>The first introduction of a mutual fund in India occurred in 1963, when the Government of India launched the Unit
    Trust of India (UTI). Mutual funds are broadly categorised into three segments: equity funds, hybrid funds, and debt
    funds.</p>



  <h2 id="MFS">Mutual Funds Statics :</h2>
  <hr>

  <ul>
    <li>The total Assets Under Management (AUM) of the Indian mutual fund industry as of December 31, 2023, stood at a
      staggering ₹50.78 trillion (US$600 billion). This is a significant milestone, marking over a six-fold increase
      compared to the ₹8.26 trillion (US$98 billion) recorded in December 2013 . </li>

    <li>According to SEBI, during FY 2022–23, 73% of mutual fund units were redeemed within 2 years of investment. Only
      investments in 3% of the units continued for more than 5 years.</li>

    <li>According to the Reserve Bank of India report, mutual funds attracted 6% of household savings in FY2023 and less
      than 1% went into direct equities. Almost 95% of household savings in India park their money in bank deposits,
      including fixed deposit, provident fund, PPF, life insurance, and various small savings schemes. </li>

    <li>According to the S&P SPIVA Report FY2022, over a 10-year period, approximate 68% of the large-cap actively
      managed funds failed to beat their respective benchmarks, and over 50% failed to beat their benchmarks in the mid-
      and small-cap segments. Within the ELSS funds category, over 60% failed to beat their respective benchmarks over
      10 year period. Globally, over long periods of time, passively managed funds consistently outperform actively
      managed funds. </li>

  <h3>List of Mutual fund companies/schemes bankrupted, defaulted or closed -</h3>

  <b>2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco :-</b>

  <p>In April 2020, Franklin Templeton India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close to $4 billion,
    citing a lack of liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic. These funds had large exposure to higher-yielding,
    lower-rated credit securities. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden
    closure and found “serious lapses and violations”. As a result, in June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual
    Fund from launching any new debt schemes for two years. The regulator also ordered the fund house to refund
    investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees, and fined the global giant another
    50 million rupees.

    Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI’s order and planned to appeal against it. The decision
    to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value for unitholders”, a spokesperson said.
    However, the closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals from other Franklin Templeton schemes as well as
    credit funds of other asset managers, leading to a storm on social media and court cases by distraught investors.
  </p>

  <h3>Relaince Mutual Funds :-</h3>
  <p>In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due to their exposure to troubled
    companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe redemptions and forced asset sales,
    which significantly affected investors</p>

  <h3>IL&FS crisis and impact :-</h3>
  <p>The IL&FS crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those managed by IDBI
    Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt obligations and
    inter-corporate deposits1. This situation caused considerable distress in the financial markets and led to
    significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected mutual fund schemes, resulting in losses to
    investors.
  </p>

  <p>The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis, making it
    difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed prices. This event
    heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking financial
    companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these securities were adversely
    affected, reflecting the increased credit risk and decreased market confidence.</p>

  <h3>Amtek Auto Impact :-</h3>
  <p>Several mutual funds, including those managed by JP Morgan Asset Management India, faced significant issues due to
    exposure to Amtek Auto, which defaulted on its debt in 2015. JP Morgan had to suspend redemptions and impose exit
    loads to manage the liquidity crisis.</p>


  <h2 id="MS">Market segments :</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Despite being available in the market, a recent report on Mutual Fund Investments in India published by research
    and analytics firm, Boston Analytics, suggests investors are holding back from putting their money into mutual funds
    due to their perceived high risk and a lack of information on how mutual funds work. There are 46 Mutual Funds as of
    June 2013. In 2019, Asset under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry rose by 13% to 24 trillion in 2018 by
    November The total assets under management (AUM) has surged by around 23.43% in 2023. The Assets base in January
    2023 was Rs.40.70lakh crores, which rose to Rs.50.24 lakh crore in Nov, 23.</p>

  <h3>Average assets under management :</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Assets under management (AUM) is a financial term denoting the market value of all the funds being managed by a
    financial institution (a mutual fund, hedge fund, private equity firm, venture capital firm, or brokerage house) on
    behalf of its clients, investors, partners, depositors, etc.
    The average assets under management of all mutual funds in India for the quarter Dec 2015 to Mar 2016(in ₹ Lakh) is
    given below</p>
